MyScheme getNumInvestors  
treeBalance is equal to 0
myTree length is equal to 6
 is equal to msg sender
numInvestorsMinusOne is equal to 0
a is equal to numInvestorsMinusOne plus 1
If amount is greater or equal to 1000000000000000000
numInvestorsMinusOne increments of 1
 is equal to msg sender
amount decreases of 1000000000000000000
treeBalance increments of 1000000000000000000
If numInvestorsMinusOne is less or equal to 2
treeBalance is equal to 0
treeDepth is equal to 1
If numInvestorsMinusOne plus 1 corresponds to myTree length
i is less then myTree length minus treeDepth minus 2
treeBalance decreases of 500000000000000000
i is equal to 0
i is less then myTree length minus treeDepth minus 2
treeBalance decreases of eachLevelGets divided by numInLevel minus 1
If numInLevel multiplied by  divided by 2 minus 1 corresponds to i
numInLevel increments of 1
myTree length increments of treeDepth plus 3
treeDepth increments of 1
treeBalance increments of amount
